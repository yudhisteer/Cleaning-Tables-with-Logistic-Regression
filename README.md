# Facial Expression Classification using Logistic Regression

## Plan of Action

1. Linear Classification
    - Equation of a linear classifier
    - The Neuron
    - Output of logistic regression
2. Optimal Weights
    - Bayes Solution
    - Error Function
    - Maximum Likelihood: Bernoulli
    - Closed-Form Solution
    - Gradient Descent
3. Regularization
    - Interpretation of the weights
    - L2 Regularization
    - L1 Regularization
    - ElasticNet
4. Special Cases
    - Donut Problem
    - XOR Problem
5. Facial Expression Recognition
